# DethRace · Android port

[![Build APK](https://github.com/mgrz18/dethrace-android/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mgrz18/dethrace-android/actions/workflows/android.yml)

Native Android build of [DethRace](https://github.com/dethrace-labs/dethrace) — the clean-room reimplementation of the 1997 game **Carmageddon**. This fork takes the upstream `opengles` branch, wires it into a Gradle/NDK project, replaces the desktop OpenGL bits with OpenGL ES 3, and adds a touch overlay and lifecycle handling so the game is actually playable on a phone.

> **The desktop builds still work.** Every Android-specific change is gated behind `#ifdef __ANDROID__` or `if(ANDROID)` in CMake. Pull from `dethrace-labs/dethrace` upstream and you'll see no behavioural differences on Linux / macOS / Windows.

  <em>Tested on Galaxy S25 Ultra (Adreno 830, Android 16) — should run on any Android 7+ device with GLES 3.</em>

## ⬇️ Just want to play?

You don't have to build anything. Each push to `android-port` produces a debug APK as a CI artifact:

1. Open <https://github.com/mgrz18/dethrace-android/actions/workflows/android.yml>
2. Click the most recent green run.
3. Scroll to **Artifacts** and download `dethrace-android-debug-apk`.
4. Unzip — inside is `app-debug.apk`.
5. Install it: `adb install -r app-debug.apk` *(or sideload from the file manager)*.
6. Provide the game data (next section).

> If you don't see Artifacts, you need to be signed in to GitHub.

## 🎮 Game data — required

> **You must own and provide your own Carmageddon files.** The APK is empty without them — it'll launch and immediately show a "Couldn't open Key Map file" error until you finish this section.

### Step 1 · Get a Carmageddon 1 install on your PC

Easiest source: **Carmageddon Max Pack** on GoG  → <https://www.gog.com/game/carmageddon_max_pack>.

After installing it on Windows, the install path is typically:

```
C:\GOG Games\Carmageddon Max Pack\
```

If you're on macOS/Linux you don't need Windows — extract the offline installer with [`innoextract`](https://constexpr.org/innoextract/) (`brew install innoextract`).

### Step 2 · Locate the two folders you'll copy

Inside the install you'll find this structure (only the bits in **bold** matter):

```
Carmageddon Max Pack/
├── CARMA/
│   └── DATA/                ← *** main game data, ~190 MB ***
├── __support/
│   └── app/
│       └── CARMA/
│           └── DATA/        ← *** GoG support files (KEYMAP_*.TXT, OPTIONS.TXT, PATHS.TXT) ***
└── (a bunch of other folders we don't need: DOSBOX, __redist, etc.)
```

You need **both** `DATA/` folders. The first is the game. The second ships with GoG and contains the keyboard mapping the engine refuses to start without.

### Step 3 · Copy them onto the phone

The game expects everything at:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/DATA/
```

(That's the app's external files dir — Android lets the app read from there without runtime permissions.)

#### Option A · From your computer with `adb` (fastest, ~5 seconds for 190 MB over USB-C)

Plug your phone in (USB debugging enabled) and run, from your PC's terminal:

```sh
# 1. The main DATA folder
adb push "Carmageddon Max Pack/CARMA/DATA" \
    /sdcard/Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/

# 2. The GoG support files merged INTO the DATA you just pushed
adb push "Carmageddon Max Pack/__support/app/CARMA/DATA/." \
    /sdcard/Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/DATA/
```

> The trailing `/.` on the second `adb push` matters — it copies the *contents* of `__support/.../DATA/` and merges them into the existing `DATA/` on the phone, instead of nesting another `DATA` folder.

#### Option B · From a file manager on the phone (no PC needed)

1. Compress `CARMA/DATA/` and `__support/app/CARMA/DATA/` into a single zip on your PC, with the layout:

   ```
   carmageddon-data.zip
   └── DATA/
       ├── CARS/
       ├── RACES/
       ├── ... (everything from CARMA/DATA)
       └── KEYMAP_0.TXT, KEYMAP_1.TXT, ... (merged in from __support)
   ```
2. Send the zip to your phone (email, Google Drive, anything).
3. Install a file manager that can write to app-private storage (e.g. **Solid Explorer**, **MiXplorer**, **Material Files**). The stock Samsung "Files" app on Android 11+ won't work — Google blocks `Android/data/` from the system file picker.
4. Extract the zip into `Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/`. The result must end up as `Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/DATA/...`.

#### Step 4 · Verify it's in the right place

```sh
adb shell ls /sdcard/Android/data/com.dethrace.android/files/DATA/ | head
# Expected output includes folders like CARS, RACES, SOUND, ACTORS
# and files like KEYMAP_0.TXT, OPTIONS.TXT
```

If you see those, you're done — open the app.

### Splat Pack and demos

- **Splat Pack** (also part of the GoG Max Pack, in `CARSPLAT/`): push `CARSPLAT/DATA/` to the same place the same way. The engine auto-detects which game mode is available.
- **Free demos** (`carmdemo`, `splatdem`, `Splatpack_christmas_demo`) work too — push their `DATA/` folder.

## 🕹️ Controls

The game launches in landscape, fullscreen, immersive (no status bar / no nav bar). Touch overlay only appears when you're actually in a race — menus stay clean and respond to plain taps.

| Region | Action | Equivalent DOS key |
|---|---|---|
| Bottom-left, left disc ◀ | Steer left | Keypad 4 |
| Bottom-left, right disc ▶ | Steer right | Keypad 6 |
| Bottom-right, brake button | Brake / reverse | Keypad 2 |
| Bottom-right, gas button | Accelerate | Keypad 8 |
| Top-right, pause icon | Pause / open menu | Esc |

Touch zones are larger than the rendered icons (you can rest your thumbs in roughly the bottom-left and bottom-right corners — you don't have to aim at the icons). For weapons, lookback, etc., pair a Bluetooth keyboard.

## 🔧 Building from source

You only need to do this if you want to hack on the port. To just play, see *Just want to play?* above.

**Requirements**
- macOS or Linux (Windows untested but should work).
- Android Studio (or the standalone command-line tools) with:
  - SDK platform 34
  - NDK r26 (`26.1.10909125` is what CI uses)
  - CMake 3.22.1+
- Java 17.
- `curl`, `tar`, `unzip` (for the SDL2 download script).

**One-time setup**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mgrz18/dethrace-android.git
cd dethrace-android

# Pull SDL2 source (~15 MB, extracts into android/app/jni/SDL/)
./android/scripts/setup-sdl.sh

# Tell Gradle where your Android SDK lives
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > android/local.properties
```

**Build**

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK lands at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

**Install + launch**

```sh
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.dethrace.android/.DethraceActivity
```

To stream the game's logs:

```sh
adb logcat -s dethrace:V DethRace:V DethRace-native:V SDL:V
```

## 🧱 What changed from upstream

A short tour of the changes — full diff in the [first commit on `android-port`](https://github.com/mgrz18/dethrace-android/commits/android-port).

**New files**

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `android/` | Gradle project, Java code, build scripts, NDK glue |
| `android/app/src/main/java/com/dethrace/android/DethraceActivity.java` | Custom `SDLActivity`: forces landscape, sets `DETHRACE_ROOT_DIR`, immersive fullscreen, mounts the touch overlay, polls race state |
| `android/app/src/main/java/com/dethrace/android/TouchOverlayView.java` | Steering discs, gas/brake pedals and pause button drawn over the SDL surface |
| `android/scripts/setup-sdl.sh` | Downloads SDL2 2.30.10 source into `app/jni/SDL/` |
| `src/harness/os/android.c` | Bionic-friendly OS layer (signal handler, case-insensitive `OS_fopen`) |
| `src/DETHRACE/android_jni.c` | JNI bridge exposing `gProgram_state.racing` to Java |

**Engine tweaks** — all `#ifdef __ANDROID__` / `if(ANDROID)`:

- `harness_trace.c` — pipe `LOG_*` to `__android_log_print` so panics show up in `logcat` instead of disappearing into stdout.
- `gl_renderer.c` — skip `glReadPixels(GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, ...)`. It's `GL_INVALID_OPERATION` on strict GLES drivers (Adreno) and was crashing on *Start Race*.
- `sdl_opengl.c` — go straight to GLES (no desktop-GL probe), load symbols with `gladLoadGLES2Loader`, cap to 60 fps via swap-interval 2 on 120 Hz panels, inject Keypad 4/6/8/2 + Esc from touch zones, pause `miniaudio` on `SDL_APP_*_BACKGROUND`.
- `harness.c` — `start_full_screen = 1` by default.
- `main.c` — include `<SDL.h>` so the `SDL_main` bridge picks it up.
- `CMakeLists.txt` patches — short-circuit `find_package(SDL2)` when SDL2 is already a target, build `dethrace` as `libmain.so`, drop pthread (in bionic), link `log android GLESv3 EGL`, swap `os/linux.c` for `os/android.c`.

## ⚠️ Limitations / known issues

- **`opengles` upstream branch is stale** — about 700 PRs behind `main`. Bug fixes landed there don't carry over yet.
- **Aspect ratio** — the engine renders at the original 320×200 (8:5). On 21:9 phones you'll see black pillars. Removing them while preserving the HUD requires non-trivial engine surgery (see *Future work*).
- **Limited input** — only steer/throttle/brake/menu. Weapons, lookback, handbrake etc. need an external keyboard or a future overlay extension.
- **Game files must be sideloaded** — for legal reasons we can't bundle Carmageddon assets.
- **No Splat Pack auto-merge yet** — push `CARSPLAT/DATA` separately if you want it.

---

## 🗺️ Future work

- Wider-FOV widescreen rendering (requires reallocating the BRender pixmap and HUD-coord remapping).
- Forward-port to upstream `main` to pick up ~700 PRs of fixes.
- Configurable touch layout, on-screen weapon buttons.
- Gamepad/keyboard remapping UI on the Android side.
- F-Droid / Play distribution once the port is more polished.

PRs welcome.
